# Tumor-Segmentation
This project implements a brain tumor segmentation model using a UNet architecture with EfficientNetB7 as the encoder. The model is trained on medical MRI datasets to accurately segment brain tumors.

-->Features

Deep Learning-based segmentation using UNet

Pretrained EfficientNetB7 encoder for feature extraction

Optimized for real-time inference (0.08 sec/image on RTX 3090)

Deployment-ready with Flask/FastAPI API support

-->Dataset

Sources: BraTS, Open Source Brain, PhysioNet

Total Images: 5,000 MRI scans

-->Preprocessing:
